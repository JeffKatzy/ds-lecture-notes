# Module 1 Projects

Welcome to module 1 projects!  You are assigned to a pair, and will have until Monday evening to work on projects.  On Tuesday, we'll move onto Module 2, and have science fair on Tuesday afternoon.

Projects are designed to review the material we covered in module 1:

* data structures
* object orientation
* SQL
* ORMs
* Flask and Dash
* ETL

Requirements for projects are the following:

* At least 3 models.  The models must include a belongs to has many relationship.
* Use of ORM aggregate methods: AVG, SUM, Count, etc.
* ETL with use of at least one, and ideally two APIs (API or scraping is fine)
* A Dash app that is connected to a Flask/sqlalchemy back end

Process:
A. Day 1

1. Choose a question you want to answer with data
For inspiration look other data projects:
* [reddit - data beautiful](https://www.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/)
Look at some nice datasets:
* [538 datasets](https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data)
* [github awesome data](https://github.com/awesomedata/awesome-public-datasets)
* [nyc datasets](https://opendata.cityofnewyork.us/)

2. Get a sense that you can answer these questions
 * Find the datasets that you plan on using, to ensure
 * Do some basic exploration of datasets in jupyter notebook

3. Model your database, and build your models

Day 2

4. Build some dummy data in your models
* begin with some basic charts

5. Integrate with API and seed database using ETL

Day 3

Iterate, iterate, iterate
